# Falco

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Falco.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Falco)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pimbrouwers/Falco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pimbrouwers/Falco)

Falco is a sinatra-like toolkit for building functional-first, [fast](#benchmarks) and fault-tolerant web applications using F#. Rooted in an ethos of low-friction web programming that is ~~free~~ of ðŸŒŸmagicðŸŒŸ, and built upon the high-performance components of ASP.NET Core, [Kestrel][1] & [Endpoint Routing][3].

Key features:
- Simple and powerful [routing](#routing) API.
- Native F# [view engine](#view-engine).
- Succinct API for [model binding](#model-binding).
- Composable [request handling](#request-handling).
- [Authentication](#authentication) and [security](#security) utilities. 
- Streaming `multipart/form-data` reader for [large uploads](#handling-large-uploads).

Design Goals:
- Aim to be very small and easily learnable.
- Should be extensible.
- Should provide a toolset to build a working end-to-end web application.

## Quick Start - Hello World 3 ways

Create a new F# web project:
```
dotnet new web -lang F# -o HelloWorldApp
```

Install the nuget package:
```
dotnet add package Falco --version 2.0.0
```

Remove the `Startup.fs` file and save the following in `Program.fs`:
```f#
module HelloWorld.Program

open Falco
open Falco.Markup

let message = "Hello, world!"

let layout message =
    Elem.html [] [
            Elem.head [] [
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw message ]
                ]
            Elem.body [] [
                    Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw message ]
                ]
        ]

let handleIndex =
    get "/" (Response.ofPlainText message)

let handleJson =
    get "/json" (Response.ofJson {| Message = message |})

let handleHtml =
    get "/html" (Response.ofHtml (layout message))

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =        
    Host.startWebHostDefault 
        args 
        [
            handleHtml
            handleJson
            handleIndex
        ]
    0
```

Run the application:
```
dotnet run HelloWorldApp
```

There you have it, an industrial-strength "hello world 3 ways" web app, achieved using primarily base ASP.NET Core libraries. Pretty sweet!

## Sample Applications 

Code is always worth a thousand words, so for the most up-to-date usage, the [/samples][6] directory contains a few sample applications.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [HelloWorld][7] | A basic hello world app |
| [Blog][17] | A basic markdown (with YAML frontmatter) blog |

## Request Handling

The `HttpHandler` type is used to represent the processing of a request. It can be thought of as the eventual (i.e. asynchronous) completion of and HTTP request processing, defined in F# as: `HttpContext -> Task`. Handlers will typically involve some combination of: route inspection, form/query binding, business logic and finally response writing.  With access to the `HttpContext` you are able to inspect all components of the request, and manipulate the response in any way you choose. 

Basic request/resposne handling is divided between the aptly named [`Request`][18] and [`Response`][16] modules.

- Plain Text responses 
```f#
let textHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.ofPlainText "Hello World"
```

- HTML responses
```f#
let htmlHandler : HttpHandler =
    let doc = 
        html [] [
                head [] [            
                        title [] [ raw "Sample App" ]                                                    
                    ]
                body [] [                     
                        h1 [] [ raw "Sample App" ]
                    ]
            ] 

    Response.ofHtml doc
```

- JSON responses

> IMPORTANT: This handler will not work with F# options or unions, since it uses the default `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`. See [JSON](#json) section below for further information.

```f#
type Person =
    {
        First : string
        Last  : string
    }

let jsonHandler : HttpHandler =
    { First = "John"; Last = "Doe" }
    |> Response.ofJson
```

- Set the status code of the response
```f#
let notFoundHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.withStatusCode 404
    >> Response.ofPlainText "Not found"
```

- Redirect (301/302) Response (boolean param to indicate permanency)
```f#
let oldUrlHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.redirect "/new-url" true
```

- Accessing route parameters.
    - The following function defines an `HttpHandler` which checks for a route value called "name" and uses the built-in `textOut` handler to return plain-text to the client:

```f#
let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun (ctx : HttpContext) ->        
        let greeting =
            Request.tryGetRouteValue "name" ctx 
            |> Option.defaultValue "someone"
            |> sprintf "hi %s" 

        Response.ofPlainText greeting ctx
```

## Routing

The breakdown of [Endpoint Routing][3] is simple. Associate a a specific [route pattern][5] (and optionally an HTTP verb) to an `HttpHandler` which represents the ongoing processing (and eventual return) of a request. 

Bearing this in mind, routing can practically be represented by a list of these "mappings" known in Falco as an `HttpEndpoint` which bind together: a route, verb and handler.

```f#
let loginHandler : HttpHandler =
  fun ctx -> // ...

let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
  fun ctx -> // ...

let endpoints : HttpEndpoint list = 
  [
    post "/login"              loginHandler        
    get  "/hello/{name:alpha}" helloHandler    
  ]

// OR alternatively
let handleLogin : HttpEndpoint =
    post "/login" (fun ctx -> // ...)

let handleHello : HttpEndpoint =
    get "/hello/{name:alpha}" (fun ctx -> // ...)

let endpoints : HttpEndpoint list = 
    [
        handleLogin
        handleHello
    ]
```

## View Engine

A core feature of Falco is the functional view engine. Using it means:

- Writing your views in plain F#, directly in your assembly.
- Markup is compiled alongside the rest of your code, leading to improved performance and ultimately simpler deployments.

Most of the standard HTML tags & attributes have been mapped to F# functions, which produce objects to represent the HTML node. Nodes are either:
- `Text` which represents `string` values.
- `SelfClosingNode` which represent self-closing tags (i.e. `<br />`).
- `ParentNode` which represent typical tags with, optionally, other tags within it (i.e. `<div>...</div>`).

```f#
let doc = 
    Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [                    
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]                                                            
                ]
            Elem.body [] [                     
                    Elem.main [] [
                            Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]
                        ]
                ]
        ] 
```

Since views are plain F# they can easily be made strongly-typed:
```f#
type Person =
    {
        First : string
        Last  : string
    }

let doc (person : Person) = 
    Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [                    
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]                                                            
                ]
            Elem.body [] [                     
                    Elem.main [] [
                            Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]
                            Elem.p  [] [ Text.raw (sprintf "%s %s" person.First person.Last)]
                        ]
                ]
        ]
```

Views can also be combined to create more complex views and share output:
```f#
let master (title : string) (content : XmlNode list) =
    Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [                    
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]                                                            
                ]
            Elem.body [] content
        ]

let divider = 
    Elem.hr [ Attr.class' "divider" ]

let homeView =
    [
        Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Homepage" ]
        divider
        Elem.p  [] [ Text.raw "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing."]
    ]
    |> master "Homepage" 

let aboutView =
    [
        Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "About" ]
        divider
        Elem.p  [] [ Text.raw "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing."]
    ]
    |> master "About Us"
```

### Extending the view engine

The view engine is extremely extensible since creating new tags is simple. 

An example to render `<svg>`'s:

```f#
let svg (width : float) (height : float) =
    Elem.tag "svg" [
        Attr.create "version" "1.0"
        Attr.create "xmlns" "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        Attr.create "viewBox" (sprintf "0 0 %f %f" width height)
    ]

let path d = Elem.tag "path" [ Attr.create "d" d ] []

let bars =
    svg 384.0 384.0 [
            path "M368 154.668H16c-8.832 0-16-7.168-16-16s7.168-16 16-16h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0M368 32H16C7.168 32 0 24.832 0 16S7.168 0 16 0h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0M368 277.332H16c-8.832 0-16-7.168-16-16s7.168-16 16-16h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0"
        ]
```

## Model Binding

Binding at IO boundaries is messy, error-prone and often verbose. Reflection-based abstractions tend to work well for simple use cases, but quickly become very complicated as the expected complexity of the input rises. This is especially true for an algebraic type system like F#'s. As such, it is often advisable to take back control of this process from the runtime. An added bonus of doing this is that it all but eliminates the need for `[<CLIMutable>]` attributes.

We can make this simpler by creating a succinct API to obtain typed values from `IFormCollection` and `IQueryCollection`. 

> Methods are available for all primitive types, and perform **case-insenstivie** lookups against the collection.

```f#
/// An example handler, safely obtaining values from IFormCollection
let parseFormHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun (next : HttpFunc) (ctx : HttpContexnt) ->
        let form = ctx.GetFormReader() // GetFormReaderAsync() also available

        let firstName = form.TryGetString "FirstName" // string -> string option        
        let lastName  = form.TryGet "LastName"        // alias for TryGetString
        let age       = form.TryGetInt "Age"          // string -> int option

/// An example handler, safely obtaining values from IQueryCollection
let parseQueryHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun (next : HttpFunc) (ctx : HttpContexnt) ->
        let form = ctx.GetQueryReader()

        let firstName = form.TryGetString "FirstName" // string -> string option        
        let lastName  = form.TryGet "LastName"        // alias for TryGetString
        let age       = form.TryGetInt "Age"          // string -> int option
```

In this case where you don't care about gracefully handling non-existence. Or, you are certain values will be present, the dynamic operator `?` can be useful:

```f#
let parseQueryHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun (next : HttpFunc) (ctx : HttpContexnt) ->
        let form = ctx.GetQueryReader()

        // dynamic operator also case-insensitive
        let firstName = form?FirstName.AsString() // string -> string
        let lastName  = form?LastName.AsString()  // string -> string
        let age       = form?Age.AsInt16()        // string -> int16
```

> Use of the `?` dynamic operator also performs **case-insenstive** lookups against the collection.

Further to this, generic `HttpHandler`'s are available to allow for the typical case of *try-or-fail* that asks for a: binding function and HttpHandler's for error and success cases.

```f#
// An example handler which attempts to bind a form
let exampleTryBindFormHandler : HttpHandler =
    tryBindForm 
        (fun r ->
            Ok {
              FirstName = form?FirstName.AsString()
              LastName  = form?LastName.AsString()
              Age       = form?Age.AsInt16()      
            })
        errorHandler 
        successHandler

// An example handler which attempts to bind a query
let exampleTryBindQueryHandler : HttpHandler =
    tryBindQuery 
        (fun r ->
            Ok {
              FirstName = form?FirstName.AsString()
              LastName  = form?LastName.AsString()
              Age       = form?Age.AsInt16()      
            })
        errorHandler 
        successHandler

// An example using a type and static binder, which can make things simpler
type SearchQuery =
    {
        Frag : string
        Page : int option
        Take : int
    }
    static member FromReader (r : StringCollectionReader) =
        Ok {
            Frag = r?frag.AsString()
            Page = r.TryGetInt "page" |> Option.defaultValue 1
            Take = r?take.AsInt()
        }

let searchResultsHandler : HttpHandler =
    tryBindQuery 
        SearchQuery.FromReader 
        errorHandler 
        successHandler
```

## Authentication

ASP.NET Core has amazing built-in support for authentication. Review the [docs][13] for specific implementation details. Falco optionally (`open Falco.Auth`) includes some authentication utilites.

> To use the authentication helpers, ensure the service has been registered (`AddAuthentication()`) with the `IServiceCollection` and activated (`UseAuthentication()`) using the `IApplicationBuilder`. 

Authentication control flow:

```f#
// prevent user from accessing secure endpoint
let secureResourceHandler : HttpHandler =
    ifAuthenticated (redirect "/forbidden" false) 
    >=> textOut "hello authenticated person"

// prevent authenticated user from accessing anonymous-only end-point
let anonResourceOnlyHandler : HttpHandler =
    ifNotAuthenticated (redirect "/" false) 
    >=> textOut "hello anonymous"
```

Secure views:
```f#
let doc (principal : ClaimsPrincipal option) = 
    let isAuthenticated = 
        match user with 
        | Some u -> u.Identity.IsAuthenticated 
        | None   -> false

    html [ _lang "en" ] [
            head [] [
                    meta  [ _charset "UTF-8" ]
                    meta  [ _httpEquiv "X-UA-Compatible"; _content "IE=edge,chrome=1" ]
                    meta  [ _name "viewport"; _content "width=device-width,initial-scale=1" ]
                    title [] [ raw "Sample App" ]                                        
                    link  [ _href "/style.css"; _rel "stylesheet"]
                ]
            body [] [                     
                    main [] [
                            yield h1 [] [ raw "Sample App" ]
                            if isAuthenticated then yield p  [] [ raw "Hello logged in user" ]
                        ]
                ]
        ]

let secureDocHandler : HttpHandler =
    authHtmlOut doc
```

## Security

Cross-site scripting attacks are extremely common, since they are quite simple to carry out. Fortunately, protecting against them is as easy as performing them. 

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery][14] package provides the required utilities to easily protect yourself against such attacks.

Falco provides a few handlers via `Falco.Security.Xss`:

> To use the Xss helpers, ensure the service has been registered (`AddAntiforgery()`) with the `IServiceCollection` and activated (`UseAntiforgery()`) using the `IApplicationBuilder`. 

```f#
open Falco.Xss 

let formView (token : AntiforgeryTokenSet) = 
    html [] [
            body [] [
                    form [ _method "post" ] [
                            // using the CSRF HTML helper
                            antiforgeryInput token
                            input [ _type "submit"; _value "Submit" ]
                        ]                                
                ]
        ]
    
// a custom handler that requires the CSRF token
let csrfHandler (token : AntiforgeryTokenSet) : HttpHandler = 
    fun (next: HttpFunc) (ctx : HttpContext) ->                                
        htmlView (formView token) next ctx

let routes =
    [
        // using CSRF html handler
        get  "/token" (csrfHtmlOut formView)

        // using token control-flow handler
        post "/token" (ifTokenValid (textOut "intruder!") >=> text "oh hi there ;)")

        // using the tokenizer with a cutom handler
        get  "/manual-token" (csrfTokenizer csrfHandler)
    ]
```

### Crytography

Many sites have the requirement of a secure log in and sign up (i.e. registering and maintaining a user's database). Thus, generating strong hashes and random salts is of critical importance. 

Falco helpers are accessed by importing `Falco.Auth.Crypto`.

```f#
open Falco.Crypto 

// Generating salt,
// using System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator,
// create a random 16 byte salt and base 64 encode
let salt = salt 16 

// Hashing password
// Pbkdf2 Key derivation using HMAC algorithm with SHA256 hashing function
// 25,000 iterations and 32 bytes in length
let password = "5upe45ecure"
let hashedPassword = password |> sha256 25000 32
``` 

## Handling Large Uploads

Microsoft defines [large uploads][15] as anything **> 64KB**, which well... is most uploads. Anything beyond this size, and they recommend streaming the multipart data to avoid excess memory consumption.

To make this process **a lot** easier Falco exposes an `HttpContext` extension method `TryStreamFormAsync()` that will attempt to stream multipart form data, or return an error message indicating the likely problem.

```f#
open Falco.Multipart 

let imageUploadHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun (next : HttpFunc) (ctx : HttpContext) ->
        task {
            let! form = ctx.TryStreamFormAsync() // Returns a standard IFormCollection
            
            return!
                (match form with 
                | Error msg -> setStatusCode 400 >=> textOut msg
                | Ok form   -> ... ) next ctx
        }
```

## JSON

Included in Falco are basic JSON in/out handlers, `bindJson<'a>` and `jsonOut` respectively. Both handlers rely on `System.Text.Json`, thus without support for F#'s algebraic types. This was done purposefully in support of the belief that JSON in F# should be limited to primitive types only in the form of DTO records.

That said, if people were open to a dependency and could agree on a package, I would be more than happy to add full JSON support. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Falco/issues) to discuss.

## Why "Falco"?

It's all about [Kestrel][1], a simply beautiful piece of software that has been a game changer for the .NET web stack. In the animal kingdom, "Kestrel" is a name given to several members of the falcon genus, also known as "Falco".
